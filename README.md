Deep-Low-Dose_CT_Convolutional_Neural_Network
The proposed algorithm learns directly from an end-to-end mapping from the low-dose Computed Tomography images for denoising the normal-dose CT images. The first method is based on a fully convolutional neural network with rectified linear units. By learning various low-level to high-level features from a low-dose image, the proposed algorithm is capable of creating a high-quality denoised image. 
The second approach is a deep convolutional neural network architecture consisting of five parts, namelyâ€” Feature extraction, Compressing,
Mapping, Enlarging, and Assembling.
